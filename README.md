# Library-System
This a simple library which was made by me and 4 of my colleagues for a database project in university

## The sysem includes the following functionalities: 

* Sign up (e.g. Admin, Author, Student, Reader, ...etc.). 
* Update profile. 
* Upload content (based on the privileges) 
* Show list of available books along with their price list. 
* Buy any of the available content. 
* Share ideas and thoughts as a comment on any content (for readers). 
* View information related to any book (Author, year, ..etc.) 
* Generate reports (for adm ins) to be able to check sales and make offers. 

## The database was designed in way that can answer the following inquiries: 

* What is the most interesting book "title" that has maximum number of buyers? 
* What was the book "title" that hadn't any buyers last month? 
* What is the number of authors whose books hadn't any buyers during last month? 
* Who are the authors who didn't upload any books yet? 
* What is the category with minimum number of books? 
* For each reader, retrieve all his/her information and the number of books he \she bought.
